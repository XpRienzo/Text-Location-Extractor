# Text Location Extractor
A Deep Learning based solution to extract location names from word sequences.

A notebook for the project I made for my undergrad 6th semester (Jan-Jun 2018). I'm planning to add an updated version to reflect my current skills while keeping the original.

The networks in the notebook were trained over about 5000 handlabelled earthquake related tweets using pre-trained GloVe word vectors.
